This project applies Value at Risk (VaR) to measure the maximum potential loss under different financial assets over a 1-year period. The first part focuses on a portfolio of 10 Indian stocks, where portfolio variance, standard deviation, and VaR are calculated using both the Variance-Covariance (VCV) and Historical Simulation (HS) methods. The results provide insights into the market risk exposure of a diversified equity portfolio.

The second part examines USD/INR exchange rate risk by calculating VaR for daily returns over the same period. This highlights the potential downside for currency exposure, an important factor for investors, traders, and businesses engaged in international trade. Both VCV and HS methods are applied to show consistency and differences between model-based and empirical risk estimation.

The third part focuses on Gold prices as a commodity investment. VaR is computed to understand potential risks in safe-haven assets compared to equities and currencies. The project includes clear calculations of average returns, variance, standard deviation, and VaR at multiple confidence intervals (95%, 99%, and 99.9%). Together, these three analyses present a comprehensive approach to quantifying risk across equities, currency, and commodities.
